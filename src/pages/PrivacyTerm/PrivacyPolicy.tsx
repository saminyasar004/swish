        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Processing basis for use of data</h2>
        <p className="text-justify text-xs">
          When we handle data, our primary task is to do so in a secure and good manner in accordance with the expectations of our users. We must also meet a number of requirements set out in Norwegian and European legislation. Among other things, all processing of personal data must have a purpose and something called a processing basis. This is related to the fact that you are the owner of your information. Before we can collect and use information about you, we must ensure that our purpose has a processing basis. Furthermore, we must ensure that the data is deleted when the purpose of the processing has been achieved.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-justify font-semibold">
          The bases used by Swish.ma for using data are the following:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-xs">
          <li>
            Consent: In cases where you have actively given us permission to process your personal data. For example, when you post a job on the service or write a review of a company you have used on the service. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance of contract: The processing of personal data may be necessary to perform a contract you have with us. For example, we need to process your contact information so that companies responding to your job know where the job is to be done and who to contact.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legitimate interest: The processing of personal data may be based on a balancing of interests. For example, when publishing jobs you have registered on the service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal obligation: In some cases, we have legal obligations that require us to process personal data. This may be, for example, that the Accounting Act requires that certain information about you who have purchased something from us must be stored for a certain number of years.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2 text-justify text-sm">
          In some cases, we may have multiple legal bases for processing your personal data at the same time. For example, we may process your personal data after you have given your consent, while at the same time we have a legal basis for doing so. Swish.ma will process your personal data if we have another legal basis for doing so.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. What is the information used for?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify text-sm">
          We use personal data to give you a customized and good experience with Swish.ma. Here are the most important purposes for which we use it:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm">
          <li>
            Provide the services you expect from us. For example, we need your contact information so that companies can contact you when you post a job.
          </li>
          <li>
            Save your time and effort through automatic login and pre-filling of forms, among other things.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understand market trends and needs through statistics. We analyze data from large groups of Swish.ma users to improve and further develop our service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personalize MyOffer to you and your interests. For example, we can show you ads for white goods if you have posted a job on kitchen renovation. You can also get recommendations and offers based on your address or location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Target content and advertising, and measure the effect. We want to show content and advertising that is as relevant to you as possible, and we measure how well it hits the target. Therefore, we use information about you, what you are watching and where you are. You may also be shown Swish.ma content that is tailored to you on websites other than Swish.ma. Our advertisers will be able to see which residences (at the municipal level) have seen or clicked on their ads. We do not give them information that identifies you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating a safe and efficient marketplace. We display your full name and postal address in the reviews you post because this creates security for other customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prevent unwanted or criminal activity. It is very important to us to ensure that Swish.ma is a safe marketplace. That is why we do what we can to prevent unwanted or criminal activity. We use several types of data to recognize rule violations and fraud attempts, including IP addresses, cookies, job and message history. If we detect anything suspicious, our customer center will take over and follow up directly. Some services may have special rules. We will inform you in each individual case.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Marketing and surveys</h2>
        <p className="text-justify text-sm">
          We may send you information about products and services by email or other types of messages. You can choose to opt out of this in your settings. All marketing we send out in this way follows marketing law.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-justify text-sm">
          We occasionally conduct surveys on behalf of ourselves or our partners. The target audience for such surveys may be based on personal data, for example, we may target a survey to people who have posted a job in the field of car repair.

        <p className="text-justify text-sm">
          Information about you and your use of the services is shared with other companies in Swish.ma Marketplaces AS to provide you with relevant advertising and recommendations. The information is also used for analytical purposes and to understand market trends across the services.

        <p className="mt-2 text-justify text-sm space-y-2">
          Swish.ma also in some cases shares personal information with other companies, organizations and individuals outside Swish.ma Marketplaces AS. This is primarily to be able to provide you with better and safer products and services. Here are the most important examples:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm">
          <li>
            When others perform services on our behalf. This can be, for example, when we use a third party to carry out contract conclusion or payment transactions. Or, for example, tools from Google Analytics and Amplitude to analyze the use of our services. These companies are not allowed to use this information for anything other than performing services for us. This is in accordance with the agreement as described in the Personal Data Act §15.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you ask us to share with others. For example, if you post a job and we send the job to relevant companies, they will have access to your contact information when they respond to the job.
          </li>
          <li>
            For security reasons. To protect you from unauthorized access to your user account, we may use external security services that are based on personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the event of suspected violations of the law, the information may be disclosed to public authorities upon request. We may also disclose information to others if necessary to prevent further fraud or if the information is needed to resolve specific disputes or breaches of contract.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Use of data processors</h2>
        <p className="text-justify text-sm">
          We use service providers who perform certain tasks for us. Some of these service providers will have access to personal data. An example of a service we are provided with is capacity for storing data. The service providers are so-called data processors for us. This means that we are still responsible for the handling of the data. The company that is a data processor can only handle information to deliver the relevant service to us. They are not allowed to process the information in any way other than as we decide. This means that they cannot use the information for their own purposes either. Our use of data processors is carefully assessed with regard to, among other things, information security to ensure that the data is processed in a responsible manner. We enter into written data processing agreements with our suppliers, in line with the requirements set out in the legislation.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-justify text-sm">
          Some of our data processors process personal data outside of Norway and the EU. It is common and legal for data to be processed outside of Norway and also outside the EU, provided that certain additional requirements are met to ensure the protection of the data.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">7. How long is personal data stored?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify text-sm">
          We do not store personal data longer or to a greater extent than is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the processing unless required by law, for example through the Accounting Act. We have comprehensive procedures for deletion and anonymization. You can yourself request insight into what personal information we have stored about you, and request removal of information from your user profile.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm mt-4">
          <li>
            The main rule is that personal data is stored for a maximum of five years. How quickly information is deleted can vary. Here are some important examples:
          </li>
          <li>
            As long as your account is active, we will keep your personal data, registered jobs, messages, published evaluations and other information you register.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have no activity on your account (login), we will delete the account and associated information after five years. This is because the Craftsman Services Act operates with a five-year right of complaint, and we want you as a user to have access to information, dialogue and agreements entered into with the craftsman during this period. You will be notified by email well in advance of deletion so that this can be stopped.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you request that a job be deleted, we will remove the job from My Jobs, and it will no longer be available on our website. However, we will retain the job for statistical and analytical purposes. The job will still be linked to your user account in our systems and may contain personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Information about usage patterns on Swi can remain in our analytics systems for up to three years. Data here is used to determine whether our services work well for the public, and whether the ongoing product development we do helps make Swish.ma better.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you request that your user profile on Swish.ma be deleted, we will remove personal information from your profile and from jobs you have created. We will also delete your copy of messages you have exchanged with companies on Swish.ma. The recipient of messages you have sent will still keep their copy of the messages. In order to address possible disputes, the personal information will remain in our administrative systems for a period of time before the information is permanently deleted.

As a general rule, we will then stop this processing of personal data, and this applies without exception if the purpose of the processing is direct marketing. Under certain circumstances, you also have the opportunity to request that the processing of your personal data be stopped or restricted. If you exercise this right, your data can only be processed based on your consent or for certain other purposes that are stated directly in the Personal Data Act.

This right only applies to information that is processed using automated methods and is based on your consent or is processed as part of the performance of a contract with you. The right to data portability only covers information that you have provided to us, either directly through, for example, a contact form or that is generated through your use of our services.

These exceptions follow from the legislation, and may, for example, mean that access to certain information cannot be granted due to considerations of the rights and freedoms of others, or that some personal data cannot be deleted because legislation or other considerations set requirements for storage time.
