              How the Full Renovation and Buildout Service Work
            </h4>
            <p className="text-sm leading-normal">
              The process begins with a detailed consultation to understand the
              client’s vision, goals, and requirements for the space. Whether
              it's updating the kitchen, adding rooms, or completely
              reconfiguring an office layout, the project scope is clearly
              defined. A professional design team works closely with the client
              to create a layout that optimizes the space for both aesthetics
              and functionality. The team ensures that the design aligns with
              the client’s budget and timeline, providing cost-effective
              solutions while maintaining quality.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm leading-normal">
              A thorough inspection of the existing property is carried out to
              assess the current structure and identify any potential issues
              that need to be addressed. This includes reviewing the foundation,
              plumbing, electrical systems, and any structural integrity
              concerns. If required, the team ensures that all necessary permits
              are obtained before work begins. Compliance with local building
              codes and regulations is strictly followed throughout the project.
              If the renovation requires the removal of existing structures,
              walls, or features, demolition is performed in a safe and
              controlled manner. The area is carefully cleared of debris to
              ensure a clean foundation for the new buildout or renovation.

              If the renovation involves adding new rooms, floors, or other
              structures, experienced builders take care of the construction.
              Whether it's installing new walls, adding doors and windows, or
              creating new spaces, the buildout is performed with precision and
              attention to detail.

              This phase can include installing new plumbing, electrical
              systems, HVAC, and insulation to enhance the functionality and
              energy efficiency of the space. Customization of Layout: During
              the buildout, adjustments can be made to the floor plan, such as
              moving walls, adding storage spaces, or expanding rooms. Custom
              cabinetry, countertops, and fixtures can be integrated to suit the
              client’s needs.
