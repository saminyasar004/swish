              How the Window & Door Work Service Works
            </h4>

            <p className="text-sm leading-normal">
              The process begins with a consultation where the customer’s needs,
              preferences, and budget are discussed. Whether it’s for new
              construction, renovations, or repairs, this step ensures the
              correct type of windows and doors are selected. A professional
              technician visits the property to evaluate the existing windows
              and doors, noting any issues such as drafts, security concerns, or
              wear and tear. This visit helps determine if the windows or doors
              need replacement, repair, or installation of new models.

            <p className="text-sm leading-normal">
              Depending on the property’s style, location, and energy efficiency
              needs, a range of materials is available, including wood, vinyl,
              fiberglass, aluminum, and steel. Each material offers specific
              advantages in terms of aesthetics, durability, and insulation.

            <p className="text-sm leading-normal">
              Customers can choose from various styles, such as single-hung,
              double-hung, sliding, casement, and bay windows. For doors,
              options include entry doors, patio doors, sliding glass doors, and
              French doors. The style selected will depend on the desired look
              and functionality.

            <p className="text-sm leading-normal mt-8">
              Old windows are carefully removed, and new ones are installed
              securely with proper sealing and insulation. Trim and finishing
              work are done for a clean, polished look. Old doors and frames are
              removed, and new doors are installed with precision, ensuring
              proper alignment and smooth operation. Weatherproofing is done to
              ensure insulation and protection from outside elements.
